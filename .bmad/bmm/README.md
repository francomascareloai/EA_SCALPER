## 🚀 Getting Started

**New Project:**

```bash
# Install BMM
npx bmad-method@alpha install

# Load Analyst agent in your IDE, then:
*workflow-init
```

**Existing Project (Brownfield):**

```bash
# Document your codebase first
*document-project

# Then initialize
*workflow-init
```

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Scale-Adaptive Design

BMM automatically adjusts to project complexity (Levels 0-4):

- **Level 0-1:** Quick Spec Flow for bug fixes and small features
- **Level 2:** PRD with optional architecture
- **Level 3-4:** Full PRD + comprehensive architecture

👉 **[Scale Adaptive System](./docs/scale-adaptive-system.md)** - Complete level breakdown

### Story-Centric Implementation

Stories move through a defined lifecycle: `backlog → drafted → ready → in-progress → review → done`

Just-in-time epic context and story context provide exact expertise when needed.

👉 **[Implementation Workflows](./docs/workflows-implementation.md)** - Complete story lifecycle guide

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Use party mode to engage all 19+ agents (from BMM, CIS, BMB, custom modules) in group discussions for strategic decisions, creative brainstorming, and complex problem-solving.
