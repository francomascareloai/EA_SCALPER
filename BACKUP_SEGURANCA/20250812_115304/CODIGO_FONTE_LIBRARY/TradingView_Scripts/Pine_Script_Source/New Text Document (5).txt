First Buy + Sell (cycle start)

When there are no open positions on the symbol:

    EA opens two trades simultaneously:

        One Buy

        One Sell

    This creates an initial hedge.

    This ensures the EA is always in the market, ready to catch the trend on either side.

? 2?? Monitor for profit

On every tick:

    EA checks the total profit from all open positions on this symbol.

    If the profit = ProfitTargetUSD (e.g., $10, $50...):

        Close all open positions.

        Reset counters.

        Start the next cycle.

? 3?? Grid on winning side only

While waiting for the target:

    EA checks price movement since the last opened trade.

    If price moves:

        For Buy:

            Price increases by GridStepPoints ? open a new Buy with slightly bigger lot (multiplied by LotMultiplier).

        For Sell:

            Price decreases by GridStepPoints ? open a new Sell with bigger lot.

    This grid keeps adding trades only on the side where the trend is going, so it avoids endless buy/sell in both directions.

? 4?? Lot size grows (grid strategy)

    Each new trade in the grid increases lot size:

        NewLot = BaseLot * LotMultiplier^number_of_trades_on_side

    This helps recover drawdown and hit the profit target faster.

? 5?? Limit number of trades

    EA won’t open more than MaxPositions (default: 10).

    Helps control risk and prevents excessive exposure.

? 6?? Close all trades when profit target is reached

    Once total profit (all open positions) = target:

        EA closes everything.

        Resets counters.

        Immediately starts a new cycle with Buy+Sell.

?? Inputs you can customize:

    ProfitTargetUSD: the profit you want per cycle.

    BaseLot: starting lot size.

    LotMultiplier: controls lot increase in the grid.

    GridStepPoints: distance in points before adding next trade.

    MaxPositions: cap on how many trades EA can open.
